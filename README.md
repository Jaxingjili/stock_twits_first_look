Exploring data analysis on stock twits data, supervised by Professor Aaron Kaufman (aaronkaufman@nyu.edu).

Stock twits is an online platform where people share their ideas on financial market by posting messages. This project foucus on exploratory analyzing the data and trying to figure out what more can be done with it. 

The raw data is grabbed by Nasser Alansari (alansari.n@nyu.edu) from the stock twits website. The data contains around 400 million messages with corresponding information such as posting time, user id, tickers, and sentiment for each of the messages. The general idea of the analysis is to find out if there is a group of people whose "sentiment divination" (bullish or bearish perspective on stocks) is continously accurate through out the time.
